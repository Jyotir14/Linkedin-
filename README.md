# LinkdIn dashboard



## Objective: 
This project focuses on analyzing LinkedIn profile metrics using Power BI. The dashboard visually represents key LinkedIn activities such as invitations, messages, reactions, and connections. The goal is to track user engagement and interaction patterns on LinkedIn over a given time period (2019-2024).
## Features of the Dashboard:
## 1. Invitation Analysis:
Invitations Received vs. Sent: A doughnut chart displaying the number of invitations received (34) and invitations sent (5). It helps track engagement with LinkedIn users.
## 2. Message Analysis:
Messages Received vs. Sent: A chart comparing the messages received (9) to the messages sent (29). This provides insights into communication activity.
## 3. Reactions by Month:
A line graph showing the number of reactions over time, helping to track the level of engagement across different months.
## 4. Connections by Position:
Displays the number of connections made based on their job positions (e.g., Committee Head, Intern, Organizer).
## 5. Connections by Company:
Shows connections categorized by companies (e.g., SRM University, Directorate of Students, ADP).
## 6. Impressions:
Displays the number of "Likes" (20) on posts and includes placeholders for other reaction types (Empathy, Appreciation, Entertainment).
## Calendar Table (DAX Code):
Purpose of the DAX code is to enables date-specific analysis in the dashboard, allowing for filtering by year, month, and week to better understand the distribution of LinkedIn activities over time.
